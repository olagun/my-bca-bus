# My BCA Bus

My high-school doesn't provide access to bus locations convenientlyâ€”here's one.


## Quick Start
Usage is fairly simple, requiring only **npm**, **yarn**, and of course, **node**.

### Install
```
yarn install
```

### Build
```bash
npm run build:dev
```

### Serve
```bash
npm start:dev
```

I created a few more shortcut commands to make development and deployment less of a pain, all located within the `package.json` configuration file.
