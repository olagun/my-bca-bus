# MyBCABus

My high-school doesn't provide access to bus locations conveniently. The only way to access bus locations is to find one of the few teachers with a iPad displaying bus locations. Sounds simple, but it's super convenient. A few students from my school decided to create an application to solve this problem. Bus locations are logged on a Google Spreadsheet and since Google provides an API to use their service, they created a website to concisely display this information. Having never used the Google Spreadsheet's API, I created my own versionâ€”here it is. I tried to use modern JavaScript techniques without utilizing any heavy frameworks.
